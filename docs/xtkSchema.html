title: The Schema API
---



<p>Reading schemas is a common operation in Campaign. The SDK provides a convenient functions as well as caching for efficient use of schemas.</p>
<p>In addition, have a look at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/application/html">Application</a> object which contains an object model for accessing and traversing schemas</p>

<pre class="code">
const schema = await client.getSchema("nms:recipient");
console.log(JSON.stringify(schema));
</pre>

<p>A given representation can be forced</p>
<pre class="code">
const xmlSchema = await client.getSchema("nms:recipient", "xml");
const jsonSchema = await client.getSchema("nms:recipient", "SimpleJson");
</pre>

<p>System enumerations can also be retreived with the fully qualified enumeration name</p>
<pre class="code">
const sysEnum = await client.getSysEnum("nms:extAccount:encryptionType");
</pre>

<p>or from a schema</p>
<pre class="code">
const schema = await client.getSchema("nms:extAccount");
const sysEnum = await client.getSysEnum("encryptionType", schema);
</pre>

<p>Get a source schema</p>
<pre class="code">
var srcSchema = await NLWS.xtkPersist.getEntityIfMoreRecent("xtk:srcSchema|nms:recipient", "", false);
console.log(JSON.stringify(srcSchema));
</pre>

<h1>Group schemas</h1>

<p>
Campaign groups represent marketing lists or audiences. Each group can have it's own specific schema, 
stored in the `extension` XML element of the group entity. This schema can be generated in a workflow by 
using the List Update activity.
</p>
<p>
The schema of a group can be retrieved using the `getSchema` method of the client or application objects.
</p>
<p>
The schema id is build as followed: prefix `temp:group:` + id of the group in mms:group (example `temp:group:1234` )
</p>

<p>Note: group schemas are not cached. The rationale is that they are not accessed as frequently as other,
  regular schemas, but more importantly that they can change more often that regular schemas.
</p>
