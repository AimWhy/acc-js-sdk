<p>
    Files can be downloaded using the <b>client.fileUploader.download</b> method. In order to download a file from the Campaign server, you need the file md5 and extension which act as the file key. For example, the md5 of a file attachment in a delivry is available in the attachment/@md5 attribute.

    In the following example, a CSV file is downloaded
</p>

<pre class="code">
    const responseFile = await client.fileUploader.download("d83d8b9a7504043644e1f2dd0a28bf7f", "csv", {
        fileName: 'My Sample File.csv',
        contentType: "txt/csv",
    });
</pre>

<p>
    The function returns a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#file-section">File Blob</a>
